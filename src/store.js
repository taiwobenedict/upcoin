                      on a piece of paper and keep it in the safest place possible. Don’t
                      store it on the same device you use to access your wallet! You’ll
                      need this recovery phrase if you ever lose access to your wallet.

                      By default, MetaMask is set to transact on the Ethereum network. You
                      can purchase Wall Street Memes (SUP) using ETH as soon as you buy or
                      send some ETH to your MetaMask public address. ETH is needed to pay
                      for gas fees for every transaction.

                    <li>
                      If you wish to buy SUP tokens using BNB, read this guide on how to
                      add the BNB Chain network to your MetaMask wallet. BNB serves the
                      same purpose as ETH and is needed to pay for gas on BNB Chain.

                      This step is very important! Write down your 12-word backup passphrase. Then manually type the 12 words in the correct sequence. You’ll need this passphrase to regain access to your wallet on a different device should you ever lose access.
