                First of all, make sure you have some extra Ethereum in your wallet for the transaction and gas fee. We recommend anything over $20 to cover the gas fee.
                Let's get right into it. First of all, go to Supcoin.co. Once you're on the website, it should look like this. Then all you have to do is press the connect button at the top right corner of the screen. Then you press MetaMask. You'll get this pop-up from MetaMask prompting you to choose the wallet. I'm choosing this one. Then press Next. Then Connect. M90y wallet is now connected.
                I now have four new buttons I can click, and at the top right corner, I can see that my wallet is now connected. If you don't get a pop-up by MetaMask when trying to connect your wallet to the Supcoin website, you might have to click the MetaMask icon at the top right corner of the screen and type in your password.
                Let's move on. So I want to buy Supcoin with Ethereum, so I'm gonna click the ‘Buy SUP with ETH’ button. Next, I want to choose how much Eth I'll pay. I click this little icon here, I can see that we have purchase bonuses. The more money I spend, the bigger the bonus I get, with the biggest bonus being 25% with a purchase amount of $50,000.
                For this informational video, I'm just going to spend around 16 bucks. Then we have step 2, choosing the vesting bonus. You don't have to vest your tokens, but the longer you vest your tokens, the bigger the bonus you get. As you can see here if I vest my tokens for 36 months, I'll get a 42% bonus, and that bonus is calculated down here.
                I'm going to go for this right now as I want the biggest bonus. Then you just press buy now. When you press buy now, you should get a metamask popup looking like this. Here I just have to press confirm. Once that's ready, it's switching around with the gas. Just press confirm. Here we go. I can see that my tokens will be vesting from April 5th and will continue to be released every second. There we go, my purchase was successful, and I now have 978 more FITEs. I can view the transaction on Etherscan if I click this button right here.
                I don't want to go into all the details right now, so I'll just leave this for now. That's how you purchase FITE using Ethereum. Thank you, guys, for watching; if you have any other concerns, keep looking at the troubleshooting page.

                content: `Hello Supcoin Family. Today I’m so excited to show you how you can purchase the SUP token using BNB on the BNB Smart Chain. Yes, the Sup Token is on Ethereum, but you can still purchase it with BNB.
                So, the first step is to go to the Supcoin.co website. Then press the ‘Connect’ button at the top right corner of the screen. Then select Metamask. Then you'll get this prompt pop-up by Metamask. If you have multiple wallets, select the one you would like to connect. Next. Then I'm going to press Connect.
                Four buttons will now appear. We have ‘Buy with ETH,’ ‘Buy with USDT,’ ‘Buy with Card’, and my referral link. However, I want to buy with BNB, so at the very bottom here, I can switch networks like so. I'll get Metamask a pop-up to switch networks - do that. And there we go. I can now buy Sup with BNB.
                Now I'm going to press the Buy Sup with BNB button. Here I choose how much BNB I want to spend. Now, if you click this little icon, you can see that we have purchase bonuses. 
                The more money you spend the bigger the bonus you get with the biggest bonus being 25% if you spend upwards of $50,000. Ok, that's step one, now step two: choosing the Vesting bonus.
                So, the longer you invest your tokens, the bigger the bonus you get. You don't have to vest your tokens at all, but I want to tie my purchase for the next bull run. So, I'm going to choose the maximum Vesting period of 36 months for a 42% bonus, which is huge.
                Then down below you can see the bonus tokens are automatically calculated, so you'll see how much you get in total. So, if I drag this all the way down to $179, now with the biggest bonus, I get $538. Then you press buy now.
                A Metamask pop-up will appear. You just have to press confirm. And there we go. You can see down here I got a notification from Metamask that the transaction was confirmed, and I can see here as well. I can press the view transaction button if I want to go into the details of all of this. And now I can see I have more SUP than I had before. If you have any other questions or concerns, or if it's not working for you, make sure you join either Discord or Telegram to get extra information and some help from our moderators.

                content: `It is a pleasure to be here with you guys! Today I'm going to show you how you can purchase the SUP coin using only your credit card. This is done through our partnership with the third-party platform Wert. With Wert you do not need to buy Ethereum, USDT or BNB from an exchange first, and best of all, no need to worry about gas fees. You do need a wallet though. Today I'm using Metamask on a Chrome browser. If you're on mobile, tap the connect button. We recommend using the trust wall app and then the rest of the steps are the same. If you don't have a wallet, then no problem. You can create a wallet with a click of a button through our partner Web3 auth. To tutorial about that, coming soon.
                So, once you're on the website, supcoin.co. The first step is to connect your wallet. Press the big Connect button at the top right corner of the screen. Then press Metamask. Then you'll get this notification and choose which wallet you want. I'm choosing this one. Then you just press Connect. Once it's connected, you get all of these new buttons that weren't there before. You can see the amount of SUP you’ve purchased before.
                NOTE: If Metamask doesn't automatically open when you press the connect button, you might have to press the Metamask icon at the top right corner of the screen and type in your password.
                Next, press ‘Buy SUP with card’. Today, I'm buying $25 worth of SUP. There are purchase bonuses depending on how much SUP you purchase up to 25%. 
                The next step is optional. You can gain up to 42% extra FGHT as a bonus depending on if you choose to vest, and for how long. I want the biggest bonus so I’m going to select 36 months.
                As you can see, the bonus tokens are calculated at the bottom. Now press ‘buy now’. A new window will pop up. Type in your phone number. Wert will send you a text message with a one-time password for security.
                Now I'm going to enter my card details. Once I've filled in the card details, now I just press continue. Here, you will get a prompt to fill in the billing details. Once you've entered your personal details, press confirm.
                Sometimes Wert takes a bit of time, so please be patient. This time, work still has to review the transaction. But as you can see, as soon as the transaction is finished, they'll send a confirmation to my email. And that's how you buy Sup with your credit card.

                So, the longer you invest your tokens, the bigger the bonus you get. You don't have to vest your tokens at all, but I want to tie my purchase for the next bull run. So, I'm going to choose the maximum Vesting period of 36 months for a 42% bonus, which is huge.
                Then down below you can see the bonus tokens are automatically calculated, so you'll see how much you get in total. So, if I drag this all the way down to $179, now with the biggest bonus I get $538. Then you press buy now.
                A Metamask pop-up will appear. You just have to press confirm. And there we go. You can see down here I got a notification from Metamask that the transaction was confirmed, and I can see here as well. I can press the view transaction button if I want to go into the details of all of this. And now I can see I have more SUP than I had before. If you have any other questions or concerns, or if it's not working for you, make sure you join either Discord or Telegram to get extra information and some help from our moderators.

                topic: "How to buy SUP using CREDIT CARD",
                content: `At Supcoin we appreciate your support! Today I'm going to show you how you can purchase the SUP token using only your credit card. This is done through our partnership with the third-party platform Wert. With Wert, you do not need to buy Ethereum, USDT, or BNB from an exchange first, and best of all, no need to worry about gas fees. You do need a wallet, though. Today I'm using Metamask on a Chrome browser. If you're on mobile, tap the connect button. We recommend using the trust wall app, and then the rest of the steps are the same. If you don't have a wallet, then no problem. You can create a wallet with a click of a button through our partner Web3 auth—to tutorial about that coming soon.
                So, once you're on the website, Supcoin.co, the first step is to connect your wallet. Press the big Connect button at the top right corner of the screen. Then press Metamask. Then you'll get this notification and choose which wallet you want. I'm choosing this one. Then you just press Connect. Once it's connected, you get all of these new buttons that weren't there before. You can see the amount of SUP you’ve purchased before.
                NOTE: If Metamask doesn't automatically open when you press the connect button, you might have to press the Metamask icon at the top right corner of the screen and type in your password.
                Next, press ‘Buy SUP with card’. Today, I'm buying $30 worth of SUP. There are purchase bonuses depending on how much SUP you purchase up to 25%. The next step is optional. You can gain up to 42% extra SUP as a bonus depending on if you choose to vest, and for how long. I want the biggest bonus so I’m going to select 36 months.
                As you can see, the bonus tokens are calculated at the bottom. Now press ‘buy now’. A new window will pop up. Type in your phone number. Wert will send you a text message with a one-time password for security.
                Now I'm going to enter my card details. Once I've filled in the card details, now I just press continue. Here, you will get a prompt to fill in the billing details. Once you've entered your personal details, press confirm.
                Sometimes Wert takes a bit of time, so please be patient. This time, work still has to review the transaction. But as you can see, as soon as the transaction is finished, they'll send a confirmation to my email. And that's how you buy SUP with your credit card.

                content: `Our gratitude is priceless for your support and for being a part of something great!  I'm so thrilled to show you how you can purchase the SUP token using Ethereum if you do not already know.
                First of all, make sure you have some extra Ethereum in your wallet for the transaction and gas fee. We recommend anything over $20 to cover the gas fee.
                Let's get right into it. First of all, go to Supcoin.com. Once you're on the website, it should look like this. Then all you have to do is press the connect button at the top right corner of the screen. Then you press MetaMask. You'll get this pop-up from MetaMask prompting you to choose the wallet. I'm choosing this one. Then press Next. Then Connect. My wallet is now connected.
                I now have four new buttons I can click, and at the top right corner, I can see that my wallet is now connected. If you don't get a pop-up by MetaMask when trying to connect your wallet to the Supcoin website, you might have to click the MetaMask icon at the top right corner of the screen and type in your password.
                Let's move on. So I want to buy Sup with Ethereum, so I'm gonna click the ‘Buy SUP with ETH’ button. Next, I want to choose how much Eth I'll pay. I click this little icon here, I can see that we have purchase bonuses. The more money I spend, the bigger the bonus I get, with the biggest bonus being 25% with a purchase amount of $50,000.
                For this informational video I'm just going to spend around 16 bucks. Then we have step 2 choosing the vesting bonus. You don't have to vest your tokens but the longer you vest your tokens, the bigger the bonus you get. As you can see here if I vest my tokens for 36 months I'll get a 42% bonus and that bonus is calculated down here.

                content: `Today is new new day our team will always be here to help and answer any of your question. Let me show you how you can purchase the SUP token using USDT on the ERC20 network.
                First, ensure you have at least 0.015 ETH in your wallet to cover the gas fee. Let's jump right into it. The first thing you need to do is go to the Supcoin.co website. Then press the connect button at the top right corner of the screen. Then select Metamask and select your wallet. Then I press ‘next’, and ‘connect’.
                As you can see now, we're connected at the top right corner of the screen. If you don't get the Metamask notification popping up when you press the connect button, you might have to press the MetaMask icon right here at the top right corner of the screen and type in your password.
                Now that we're connected, we can see we have four new buttons to play with. Select ‘buy Sucoin with USDT.’ You can see I have 9.9 USDT in my wallet, and I have enough Ethereum to cover the gas fee. Otherwise, I would get a red warning message saying that the transaction won't go through. I'm going to spend the maximum amount of USDT I can by selecting ‘max’.
                Now for bonuses. and here we can see if we press this little icon here next to the bonus, we can see that there are purchase bonuses based on how much you buy. $50,000. Next is the optional vesting bonus. You don't have to vest your tokens, but the longer you vest your tokens, the more tokens you receive. if I vest my tokens for 12 months, I get an 18% bonus. I want the biggest bonus of 42% so I'm going to vest my tokens for 36 months. Then all I have to do is to press buy now. MetaMask will show up here and now I just press confirm.
                And there we go; we can see my purchase was successful, I just got the notification from Metamask down there as well. You can view the transaction on Etherscan if you click view transaction. You can see all of the details, I'm not too interested in that right now, so I'm just going to close this. I have an extra 470 tokens there, I believe now, so we can see that that transaction went through, and I will be able to claim these tokens Once the presale is over So thank you for watching. That's how you buy Sup using USDT on the ERC 20 network if you have any other concerns or issues, keep watching on the troubleshooting page or Join the telegram or the discord to get additional help from our moderators.

                MetaMask is a self-custody wallet that only you control. Visit the ​MetaMask website and install the extension for your preferred browser. The most common are Chrome and Firefox.
                Create your new wallet
                After installing MetaMask, click on‘Create a Wallet’. Your wallet is a public key comprising randomly generated numbers and letters. This is your identifier on the blockchain, like a bank account number for your crypto.
                Set a password for your wallet
                Next, create a password to log in to your wallet. Choose a secure password with letters, numbers, and special characters. Try to use a different password to your others.
                Save and write down recovery phrase
                Before you do anything else, write down your 12-word recovery phrase on a piece of paper and keep it in the safest place possible. Don’t store it on the same device you use to access your wallet! You’ll need this recovery phrase if you ever lose access to your wallet.
                Use the Ethereum or BNB Chain network
                By default, MetaMask is set to transact on the Ethereum network. You can purchase Wall Street Memes (SUP) using ETH as soon as you buy or send some ETH to your MetaMask public address. ETH is needed to pay for gas fees for every transaction.
                If you wish to buy SUP tokens using BNB, read this guide on how to add the BNB Chain network to your MetaMask wallet. BNB serves the same purpose as ETH and is needed to pay for gas on BNB Chain.
                Claiming your SUP tokens
                After buying SUP tokens, you can see how much you’ll be able to claim on the website’s home page. After the presale, once claiming is activated, you’ll be able to claim your SUP tokens to the same MetaMask wallet address you used to contribute.
                Import SUP to MetaMask
                After buying SUP tokens, you can see how much you’ll be able to claim on the website’s home page. After the presale, once claiming is activated, you’ll be able to claim your SUP  tokens to the same MetaMask wallet address you used to contribute.

                There are many mobile wallets out there, but Trust Wallet is widely recommended. Download the app from your preferred app store, depending on your mobile device.
                Start a new wallet.
                Click on the ‘Create a Wallet’ button to start a new wallet that you can use on your mobile phone. Set a new password if prompted to do so.
                Save your passphrase
                This step is very important! Write down your 12-word backup passphrase. Then manually type the 12 words in the correct sequence. You’ll need this passphrase to regain access to your wallet on a different device should you ever lose access.
                Use Ethereum or BNB Chain
                Trust Wallet supports transactions on Ethereum or BNB Chain. You can purchase Wall Street Memes (SUP) using ETH or BNB as soon as you buy or send some ETH or BNB to your Trust Wallet address. ETH or BNB is needed to pay gas fees for every transaction.
