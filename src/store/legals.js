        <p>See our <a href="#">"Risk Disclosure</a></p>
        <p>
          We would like to reiterate that you should only purchase Supcoin tokens if
          you fully understand the tokenomics of Supcoin supply and issuance and the
          Supcoin economy. Because of the immutable nature of blockchain transactions
          and the lack of uniform regulation for crypto assets, there may be no remedy
          if assets expire or a successful theft or attack by malicious actors were to
          take place against the Ethereum chain that the Supcoin platform is built on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each prospective Supcoin purchaser should weigh up their own individual
          appetite for risk and consider consulting an independent financial adviser,
          tax professional, accountant, or lawyer before making any decisions.

        <p>
          Forecasts for Supcoin should be approached with a grounded and realistic
          perspective, avoiding groundless assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the project holds immense potential, it is essential to consider
          various factors that can impact the future trajectory of Supcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          These include market dynamics, regulatory developments, and competition
          within the cryptocurrency space. A prudent forecast acknowledges the
          challenges and uncertainties inherent in the crypto market, ensuring that
          expectations align with the project's progress, market conditions, and user
          adoption. It is crucial to consider Supelle's continuous innovation, the
          community's response, and the ability to navigate potential obstacles along
          the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          By staying informed, analyzing trends, and monitoring the project's growth,
          forecasts for Supcoin can be made with a balanced outlook that takes into
          account both the project's potential and the broader market dynamics. This
          approach ensures a realistic assessment of Supcoin's future prospects while
          avoiding unfounded assumptions that may undermine the credibility of the
          forecast.

          <span class="bold">Global Reach:</span> With the ability to be issued and
          traded globally, ERC20 tokens enable companies and organizations to access a
          worldwide investor base. This eliminates traditional fundraising methods and
          opens up new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          <span class="bold">Liquidity:</span> ERC20 tokens can be easily traded on
          cryptocurrency exchanges, providing liquidity for token holders. This allows
          them to buy or sell their tokens, enhancing their marketability
          conveniently.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          <span class="bold">Lower Costs:</span> Compared to traditional fundraising
          methods like IPOs, issuing ERC20 tokens often costs less. This affordability
          extends across transaction costs, contributing to a more cost-effective
          ecosystem for all participants.

          The Decentralized Freelance Marketplace Ecosystem, built on the Ethereum
          Blockchain, represents the future of global freelancing, enabling a
          streamlined and democratized entry into the freelance industry by
          eliminating intermediaries and centralized authorities.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The decentralized nature of the ecosystem ensures security, transparency,
          and high efficiency by connecting directly to the blockchain instead of
          relying on centralized servers. This approach breaks down barriers, offering
          unparalleled flexibility, equality, and access to work opportunities
          worldwide.

        </ul>
      
        <h6 class="bold mt-5">For contributors:</h6>
      
        <p>
          Contributors to the Supelle project, which may include developers, community
          members, and strategic partners, also derive value from Supelle Coin. As
          contributors actively participate in the growth and development of the
          ecosystem, holding Supelle Coin grants them various benefits. This may
          include opportunities for staking or participating in governance decisions,
          where they can have a direct impact on the project's trajectory.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Supelle Coin acts as an incentive for contributors, rewarding their
          contributions with tangible value within the ecosystem. By holding Supelle
          Coin, contributors can participate in the decision-making process, shape the
          future direction of the project, and gain access to exclusive features or
          benefits. This value proposition fosters a vibrant and engaged community,
          where contributors and developers are recognized and incentivized for their
          efforts.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Moreover, as the Supelle ecosystem expands and gains adoption, the value of
          Supelle Coin may appreciate over time. Early contributors and long-term
          holders may benefit from the potential increase in the token's value,
          further enhancing the value proposition for contributors.
        </p>
      
        <h6 class="mt-5 bold">In summary</h6>
        <p>
          Supelle Coin provides value to both the project's audience, consisting of
          freelancers and clients, and contributors to the Supelle ecosystem. It
          empowers freelancers by enabling efficient payments and enhances the
          experience for clients by streamlining transactions. Additionally,
          contributors benefit from their involvement in the project through
          participation in governance decisions and potential appreciation of the
          token's value.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Supelle Coin's value proposition supports the growth, engagement, and
          success of the Supelle ecosystem as a whole. When using ICO offerings in the
          freelance marketplace, there are several legal considerations to keep in
          mind. These are some of the legal considerations: Regulatory Compliance:
          ICOs are subject to regulatory compliance, and companies must ensure that
          they comply with the relevant territorial laws that govern how these
          transactions must be held
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Failure to comply with these regulations can result in legal consequences.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          1 Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer Laws: Once a company is SEC
          registered, any ICO tokens it offers must comply with anti-money laundering
          laws and know-your-customer laws too
        </p>
      
        <p>
          2 Transparency: ICOs must be transparent about the project's goals, the use
          of funds, and the risks involved . Companies must provide clear and accurate
          information to investors to avoid legal consequences.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Failure to do so can result in legal consequences. <br> 4 Contractual
          Obligations: Companies must ensure that they fulfil their contractual
          obligations to investors Failure to do so can result in legal consequences.

        <p class="bold">
          By accepting this agreement, you and Wefreelancer Global Tech are each
          waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be requested to provide us with your personal data, such as KYC
          documents in case of a dispute between you and Us or to comply with legal
          and regulatory requirements. In such cases, we expect you to provide us with
          the requested information for further processing and action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parties will attempt to resolve all disputes, controversies, or claims
          arising under, out of, or relating to the Site or Content or to these Terms,
          in accordance with the procedures outlined in this Section. Except as noted
          below, if any Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations between the
          parties within 5 days of notice from one party to the other of the Dispute,
          such Dispute will be finally settled through binding arbitration under the
          arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) then in effect
          (the Rules). Either party may commence the arbitration by delivering a
          request for arbitration as specified in the Rules. The arbitration will be
          conducted before a sole neutral arbitrator selected by the agreement of the
          parties.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator within
          30 days (the Initial Period) after either party to these Terms delivers a
          request for arbitration, a neutral arbitrator will be selected as provided
          in the Rules. The arbitration will be conducted exclusively in the English
          language at a site specified by Supelle in the USA. The arbitrator’s award
          will be the parties’ exclusive remedy for all claims, counterclaims, issues,
          or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s
          award will require payment of the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the
          prevailing party in any such arbitration by the non-prevailing party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court or governmental body
          having jurisdiction thereof. Any additional costs, fees, or expenses
          incurred in enforcing the award may be charged against the party that
          resists its enforcement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
          no arbitration shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party
          subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or
          otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the following
          matters shall not, at the election of Supelle, be subject to binding
          arbitration: (a) any dispute concerning Supelle or its suppliers or service
          providers’ Intellectual Property Rights; (b) any dispute related to or
          arising from allegations of criminal activity; or (c) any claim for
          injunctive relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supelle’s liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance arising
          from this agreement is limited to U.S. $100.

          such third party. Accordingly, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you

          all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind

          Important Information on Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Risk
        </p>
        <p>
          Wefreelancer Global Tech (the parent company of Supelle) believes that
          cryptocurrency is the future of finance. Hence, we are proudly collaborating
          with experts, industry leaders, and policymakers in the U.S. and
          internationally as we develop our platform. However, while this digital
          platform is full of potential and promise, it does have certain risks
          involved.future
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We encourage all users of cryptocurrencies and digital assets to conduct
          their own due diligence before opening an account and/or buying, selling, or
          trading cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Please evaluate your particular
          financial circumstances to determine whether or not trading cryptocurrencies
          is appropriate for you.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Do not invest funds in cryptocurrencies that you cannot afford to lose.
          Transactions in cryptocurrency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses
          due to accidental transactions, changes in the ecosystem, etcetera may not
          be recoverable.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Potential Tax Implications.</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Capital Gains:</b> If you buy and hold digital or virtual currencies as an investment, you may be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them for a profit. The tax rate will depend on how long you held the asset and your tax bracket.</li>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <b>Income:</b> If you receive digital or virtual currencies as payment for goods or services, this income may be taxable. The value of the currency at the time you receive it would be included in your gross income for tax purposes.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Foreign Accounts:</b> If you hold digital or virtual currencies in foreign accounts, you may be required to report those accounts to your government and pay taxes on any income earned from them.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p class="bold mb-4">Consult with a Professional: </p>
        <p>Laws and regulations regarding digital and virtual currencies are still evolving, and there may be additional tax implications in the future. We recommend that you consult with a licensed tax professional to fully understand your tax obligations when using digital or virtual currencies.
        </p>
      
        <p class="bold mb-4">Account Insurance</p>
        <p>Any insurance or surety bonds maintained by Supelle for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses incurred by customers. </p>
      
        <p class="bold mb-4">Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Features</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are digital representations of value that function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but do not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived from market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies.
        </p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are subject to changes or may otherwise cease to operate as expected due to changes made to their underlying technology, changes made using their underlying technology, or other general changes, whether anticipated or unpredicted. These changes can include, but are not limited to, forks, rollbacks, airdrops, or bootstraps.</p>
      
        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>Fork: A split in the blockchain network.</li>
          <li>Rollback: A reversal of a transaction on the blockchain.</li>
          <li>Airdrop: A distribution of tokens to users for free.</li>
          <li>Bootstrap: The initial distribution of tokens in a new cryptocurrency network.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p class="bold mt-4">Government Regulations and Legal Solutions</p>
        <p>Future legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future, and there may be few, if any, options regarding legal solutions.</p>
      
        <p class="bold mt-4">Transactions and Other Fees</p>
        <p>While Supelle does guarantee to keep our transaction fees as low as possible, the amounts of these fees are subject to market forces. As we do our best to render the best services we can, it is possible that the fees could increase substantially during a period of increased activity or volatility.
        </p>
        
        <p>You can learn more about our fees here.</p>
