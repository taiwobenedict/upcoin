                        After installing MetaMask, click on‘Create a Wallet’. Your wallet is
                        a public key comprising randomly generated numbers and letters. This
                        is your identifier on the blockchain, like a bank account number for
                        your crypto.

                        Next, create a password to log in to your wallet. Choose a secure
                        password with letters, numbers, and special characters. Try to use a
                        different password to your others.

                        Before you do anything else, write down your 12-word recovery phrase
                        on a piece of paper and keep it in the safest place possible. Don’t
                        store it on the same device you use to access your wallet! You’ll
                        need this recovery phrase if you ever lose access to your wallet.

                      <li>
                        By default, MetaMask is set to transact on the Ethereum network. You
                        can purchase Wall Street Memes (SUP) using ETH as soon as you buy or
                        send some ETH to your MetaMask public address. ETH is needed to pay
                        for gas fees for every transaction.

                      <li>
                        If you wish to buy SUP tokens using BNB, read this guide on how to
                        add the BNB Chain network to your MetaMask wallet. BNB serves the
                        same purpose as ETH and is needed to pay for gas on BNB Chain.
