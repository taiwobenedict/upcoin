                question: `Allowing tokens to be moved from your MetaMask wallet`,
                answer: `<p>When choosing to trade Supcoin, the Ethereum blockchain will require that you first approve Supelle to move tokens in and out of your wallet.<br>

                This approval requires you to have Ethereum in your wallet to be able to pay the transaction fee to the network.<br>
                
                Once you hit the ‘Confirm’ button on the MetaMask extension, you will be able to monitor the approval transaction by visiting the ‘Activity’ section of your MetaMask wallet.<br>
                
                Once the allowance has been granted successfully, you will be able to place a sell order.

            },
            {
                question: `What is a token allowance and how does it work?`,
                answer: `<p>Token allowance is a commonly used feature of blockchain transactions. It is needed for Supelle to move your tokens if they are sold. Token allowance is granted using the ‘ERC20 approve’ method, which allows an address to transfer tokens, without revealing the private key of your wallet.</p> 

                <p>Before selling your utility tokens, you must grant an allowance for each token separately. This allows Supelle to transfer tokens from your wallet to the buyer’s wallet.</p>
                
                <p>To grant an allowance, simply click the ‘Grant allowance’ button. This will prompt your Metamask extension to open. In your Metamask extension, click ‘Confirm’ and wait for the process to be completed.</p>
                
                <p>The transaction is done on the Ethereum blockchain, which means it costs gas fees and may take a few minutes.</p>
                
                <p>By default, the allowance amount is set to allow future orders without needing to grant additional allowances. This simplifies the trading process and reduces the amount of gas fees you will need to pay as a result of granting multiple allowances. If you choose to edit the allowance, this can be done through the Metamask interface by clicking on ‘Edit Permission’.</p>

                answer: `<p>Your Supcoin balance is displayed on Supelle; however, Supelle does not have custody of your tokens. Supcoins are custodied in your Metamask wallet</p>
                
                <p>Note: Even after buying tokens on the Supelle platform, they may not show up until the below steps are completed:</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Log in to your MetaMask wallet </li>
                    <li>Click on the Supcoin contract address here to view it on Etherscan  </li>
                    <li>On the right-hand side, click on the MORE button to reveal the drop-down list </li>
                    <li>Select Add Token to MetaMask (Web3) </li>
                    <li>Click on the ‘Add Token’ button and that’s it. Existing tokens will show up in the wallet and new ones will be visible once bought and after the trade settles. </li>

                question: `Can I change the MetaMask wallet associated with my account?`,
                answer: `<p>Once your Metamask wallet address is linked, this is the only address that can be used to trade Supcoin (utility tokens).</p>

                <p>Addresses can be changed in certain cases, mainly related to the security of your Metamask wallet. If you feel this applies to you please contact support at <a href="http://supcoin.co/support/index.html">http://supcoin.co/support/index.html. </a>.</p>

                question: `What does ‘speed-up’ mean in the Metamask wallet?`,
                answer: `<P>The wallet allows you to increase the payment to miners who approve your blockchain request. If you decide to speed up the allowance, you will have to decide on how much more you are willing to pay for the increased speed of approval. Increased ETH (gas) payment will speed up the process.

                answer: `<p>No, you can only select one Metamask address to be linked and that address will be whitelisted on the blockchain. As only whitelisted wallets can hold digital tokens, it is important to link the address you want to use for tokens trading. 

                While you can only trade from one linked MetaMask address, you can whitelist several addresses. Click here for more information on this. </p>`,

                question: `Why is whitelisting necessary?`,

For transfers of utility tokens to be successful, the wallet addresses of both the seller and buyer need to be listed on the “Whitelist Database” of Supcoin. </p>

                <p>You can also whitelist your wallet through the portal available on our website. If you participated in the IPO, please use the same username and password to log into your account. If any additional information is needed, you will be contacted.</p>

                answer: `<p>The ideal wallet to whitelist with Supelle is a non-custodial ERC 20 compatible account that supports the addition of custom tokens. The only option at this time is: <a href="https://metamask.io/">https://metamask.io/ </a> </p>

                <p>Metamask is the only wallet that can be used for Supcoin trading on Supelle, but other wallets can be whitelisted to hold in cold storage.</p>
                
                <p>Any wallet address associated with an exchange (Binance, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com, Coinbase.com) will not be able to receive Supcoin.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that if you wish to sell or purchase Supcoin on the secondary market you will need to whitelist a Metamask wallet address, as this is the only wallet provider that custodies Supcoin.</p>

                answer: `<p>If either the seller’s or buyer’s wallet address is not listed in the Whitelist Database (or if the Company has “frozen” the user’s wallet address), the smart contract rejects the transfer and the Supcoin Token Distributed Ledger is not updated. </p>`,

                <p>If a token is at its limit for U.S. holders, U.S. Users will only be able to bid if they are already holders of the token. Bids will not be accepted from U.S. Users not currently holders of the token until the holder count is below its limit.</p>
                
                <p>Any open bid orders by U.S. Users not currently holders of the token will be canceled when a token reaches its U.S. holder limit.</p>

                <p>You are required to report any sales, conversions, payments, and income to the IRS.

                question: `What is the difference between cryptocurrencies and utility tokens?`,
                answer: `<p>Cryptocurrencies and utility tokens are both types of digital assets that use blockchain technology, but they serve different purposes within their respective ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are designed to function as digital currencies that can be used as a medium of exchange. They aim to serve as a decentralized form of money, enabling secure and direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Cryptocurrencies often operate on their own blockchain networks and are generally used for storing value, making payments, or speculating on their price movements.</p>
                
                <p>On the other hand, utility tokens like Supcoin are specific to a particular blockchain-based platform or application. These tokens are created to provide access to the features, products, or services offered by the platform. Utility tokens act as a unit of value within the ecosystem and enable users to participate in various activities, such as accessing premium features, receiving discounts, or obtaining specific rights or privileges.</p>

            },
            {
                question: `What is a blockchain?`,
                answer: `<p>Blockchains are linked blocks of data and each new block contains new information which is added, shared, and stored by many computers on a network. For example, if you buy Bitcoin, the record of your ownership is stored in a new block of data on the Bitcoin blockchain, and all computers that are part of that Bitcoin network share and add that new block to the existing chain of blocks. Different cryptocurrencies mostly run on their respective blockchains. ETH runs on the Ethereum blockchain and so on.</p>

                <p>To hold a digital asset on a blockchain, investors need a digital wallet which is a secure and unique address on the blockchain.</p>
                
                <p>The benefits of blockchains apply to many industries including Financial Services where, for example, blockchain technology has created the ability to instantly send and receive (instant settlement) cryptocurrencies across international boundaries. The traditional banking models typically take 1-2 days for settlement.</p>
                
                <p>Cryptocurrency and Utility Token transactions can be monitored on a blockchain explorer for real-time or historical confirmation of completion, status, or delays.</p>

                question: `What is a blockchain explorer?`,
                answer: `<p>Transactions and wallet addresses on a public blockchain can be viewed using a blockchain explorer.</p>

                <p>Since blocks of data on the chain are shared by numerous computers on the network, the data including transactions, sender and receiver wallet addresses, time, and date are also available for public access using explorers, many of which are open source or provided by third parties.</p>
                
                <p>A notable blockchain explorer is Etherscan which can be used to monitor transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Enter a wallet ID or transaction ID or contract address in the search bar for results.</p>
                
                <p>A Google search for LTC explorer or ZEC explorer will yield multiple results for user-friendly explorers of those blockchains.</p>

                question: `What is FIAT currency and what is Cryptocurrency?`,
                answer: `<p>FIAT money is a legal tender like the US ($) dollar or Euro (€) that is tied to a government-issued currency. FIAT can be used as physical notes or electronic payments using online banking and debit or credit cards. FIAT currency is backed by a central government and its supply is also controlled by the government.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrency is a purely digital asset that is created on and derives value from its native blockchain. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized asset governed by cryptography and its supply is controlled by an algorithm. Common examples are Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ether (ETH).</p>

                <p>Supelle does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice, and we provide this information for educational purposes only and all users of cryptocurrencies and digital assets are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence before opening an account and/or buying, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies and digital assets.</p>
                
                <p>You must evaluate your particular financial circumstances to determine whether or not trading cryptocurrencies is appropriate for you. You should not invest funds in cryptocurrencies that you cannot afford to lose. The trading of cryptocurrencies can result in substantial losses, including most or all of your investment.</p>

                Here are some of the numerous risks associated with cryptocurrency trading
                <ul>
                    <li>Cryptocurrencies are volatile and often see sharp and sudden moves due to many reasons including market sentiment</li>
                    <li>Regulatory changes and differences from country to country may adversely affect cryptocurrency prices and liquidity</li>
                    <li>Some cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to others and may see sudden price movements as a result</li>
                    <li>Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to cryptographic errors and hackers</li>
                    <li>Cryptocurrencies may be discontinued or abandoned or split through hard-forks</li>
                    <li>Transactions may be irreversible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable</li>
